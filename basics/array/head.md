# Array

## head

`head` function returns first element of an array if possible. To handle _if possible_ this function either returns a `Just<FirstElement>` or a `Nothing`. The result is captured inside a container named [Maybe](../COMINGSOON.md). If you want to free it up please refer to [fromMaybe](../COMINGSOON.md).
